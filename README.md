# goSorensen: Interactive Results Viewer for `allOncoGeneLists`

This Shiny-based application provides an interactive visualization of the main outputs generated by the `goSorensen` package (version **1.10.0**) as available in **Bioconductor 3.16**. It is intended as a companion tool to a research article submitted to *The R Journal*, which introduces a statistical method for comparing gene lists based on the Sorensen‚ÄìDice index and joint enrichment of the GO (Gene Ontology) terms.

## üîç Purpose

The application is specifically tailored to visualise the results obtained from the object `allOncoGeneLists`, which is an object of the `goSorensen` package. It offers a dynamic interface that complements the empirical analysis described in the article and helps users explore the statistical outputs in a reproducible and intuitive manner.

## üß¨ Features

- **Ontology selection**: Biological Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC), Molecular Function (MF)
- **GO level selection**: Levels 3 through 10
- **Selection of the main inputs for equivalence hypothesis tests:**
  - Irrelvance limit $d_0$
  - Confidence level $\alpha$
  - Sample distribution (Normal or Booststrap)
- **Interactive visualizations of**:
  - ENTREZ identification of the genes in the lists
  - Enrichment matrix for a specific ontology and GO-level
  - Enrichment contingency table for a pair of lists in a specific ontology and GO-level
  - Equivalence test results for a pair of lists in a specific ontology and GO-level
  - Matrix of dissimilarities for a specific ontology and GO-level
  - Dendrogram (hierarchical clustering) for a specific ontology and GO-level
  - MDS biplot for a specific ontology and GO-level
  - Identification of the GO terms related with the biological similarity between feature lists
  
All components correspond to key functions in the `goSorensen` package and reflect the workflow described in the methodology section of the associated article.

## üìò Scope and Limitations

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This app is not a general-purpose platform for arbitrary gene list analysis.  
It is **designed exclusively to visualize results derived from the `allOncoGeneLists` object**, and should be interpreted as a companion to the article, rather than a standalone analytical tool.
